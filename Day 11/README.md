## üóÉÔ∏è 1. Delete the Database
```db.dropDatabase()``` This command is used in MongoDB to delete the currently selected database.

- ```db``` refers to the current database you're working in.
- ```.dropDatabase()``` is a method that drops (deletes) the entire database, including:
  - All collections (tables)
  - All documents (records)
  - All indexes

## üìÅ 2.Delete the collection
```db.sampledata.drop()``` This command in MongoDB is used to delete a specific collection in the current database.

- ```db```  refers to the current database you're using.
- ```sampledata``` is the name of the collection you want to delete.
- ```.drop()``` deletes that collection entirely.

### ‚úÖ What it does:
- Deletes the collection named sampledata.
- All documents inside it are removed.
- Indexes on the collection are removed.

## üìù 3. Delete a Document
```db.degrees.deleteOne({_id:ObjectId('681a3cc10b635026ae4a2a1f')})``` This command is used to delete a single document from the ```degrees``` collection, based on its ```_id```.

- ```db.degrees``` ‚Äì Refers to the ```degrees``` collection in the current database.
- ```deleteOne()``` ‚Äì Deletes only the first matching document.
- ```{_id: ObjectId('...')}``` ‚Äì Specifies the document to delete by its unique ```_id``` (MongoDB uses ObjectId for ```_id``` by default).

## üîç 4. Field Projection
i). ```db.degrees.find({}, { name: 1, duration: 1 })``` This command is used to retrieve only specific fields (```name``` and ```duration```) from all documents in the ```degrees``` collection. 

### ‚úÖ Why Use It:
- To view only the necessary fields, not the entire document.
- Helps in reducing data transfer, especially when documents have many fields.
- Makes query results easier to read and work with.

ii). ```db.degrees.find().projection(['name'])``` This command is used to retrieve only the ```name``` field from all documents in the ```degrees``` collection (along with ```_id``` by default).

### ‚úÖ Why Use It?
- To focus on specific data (e.g., only degree names)
- To reduce the amount of data returned (faster queries, especially in large collections)
- Useful in reports, dropdowns, or lists where only one field (like names) is needed

iii).```db.degrees.find().projection([{'name':1},{'_id':-1}])``` This command is used to retrieves only the ```name``` field from each document in the ```degrees``` collection.

### ‚úÖ Why Use It?
- To fetch only the name field from each document.
- To exclude the default _id field from the results.
- Useful for displaying clean lists, dropdowns, or exports where _id is not needed.
